# Interactive Molecular Dynamics - Periodic Boundary Conditions

Adaptation of the "Interactive Molecular Dynamics" code written by Daniel V. Schroeder. You can find the original implementation [here](https://physics.weber.edu/schroeder/md/).

This patch includes the option to enable periodic boundary conditions (PBCs).
